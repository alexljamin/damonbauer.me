Yesterday, I gave a 30 minute talk about Flexbox to some teammates. In it, I talk about how we can use Flexbox today and look at a few real world examples and compare how to author the example with "traditional" CSS vs Flexbox.

Here are the slides from the talk:

</object><br>

This was my first time doing a technical talk. I thought it went pretty well but I do know a few places where I want to improve (if there is a next time).
